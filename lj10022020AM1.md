	As a professional one is expected to show potential employers the ability to exercise professional competencies and proficiencies. Employers want excellence - not casual. Lacking in these areas is the number one obstacle to getting hired quickly.

## Areas of Growth
1.	**Adaptability**
-	I struggle with accepting change quickly. I can be persistent in old ways of thinking. I also tend to be easily discouraged.
2.	**Handling Ambiguity**
-	I tend to continue digging for information, needing to gather much before feeling comfortable in decisions. Often I can see multiple sides of an issue clearly and, without ample information to support a particular path, can be paralyzed with indecision.
3.	**Ambition and Initiative**
-	I tend towards procrastination and find myself taking comfort in idle time. So, if there is not a task or deadline readily available I lean towards focusing myself on projects or thoughts that have recently piqued my interest. 

## Areas of Strength
1.	**Curiosity**
-	I am a detail-oriented person, so often I will ask questions that lead thought processes into greater detail or to nuanced places. I enjoy asking these questions and discovering new or deeper information about topics that interest me or the people around me.
2.	**Openness**
-	An important aspect of curiosity is being open to what information may be given to you. As I seek deeper understandings, Iâ€™m open to the paths that are found and curious about their course. I am deeply interested by improving processes and open to the forms in which those improvements might manifest.
3.	**Inclusivity**
-	The surest way to gain new information and improve upon systems is to consider input from all manners of perspective. Diversity in thought offers the most varied solutions to a problem and the most interesting ways of building or revolutionizing ideas. This is particularly important for marginalized perspectives, because I believe the path for a product or service that has the most potential to do the most good is found through the lens of the least often heard.
