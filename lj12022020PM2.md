## What Is a Computer

**Computers** are man’s thinking tool. Where hammers, and pulleys, and tractor trailers are tools to help man manipulate physical substance, computers exist to manipulate information. All computers perform four necessary tasks:

1.	They take input
2.	They store information
3.	They process information
4.	They produce output

The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical gears. Computers began using electrical components in the 20th Century. A computer the size of a room could take hours to do a basic math problem.  
Inputs give a computer information, which it stores. Then, it’s processor takes the information, applies an **algorithm** (a series of commands) to it, and places it back in the memory. It repeats this process until it is ready to produce an output. Outputs range from visual display to impulses that might control other machines or electronics.


## Data & Binary

Inside a computer are wires and circuits used to send and store information. A single wire can be either “on” or “off”, “true” or “false”, “1” or “0”. This state is called a **bit**, and it is the smallest piece of information a computer can store.  It is the foundation of **Binary**.  
Binary can represent any number using just 1’s and 0’s and enough wires. Text, images, and sound can also be stored as numbers. Text can be broken down to letters represented by numbers, images down to colors in a **pixel** (the microscopic visual block on a computer screen) represented by numbers, and sound can be broken down into waveforms represented by numbers.


## Circuits & Logic

In order to take inputs, process the information, and produce outputs a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals. To do this, computers use millions of tiny electrical components called **circuits**. A simple circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it. More complex circuits can take multiple signals and combine them. The operators within these circuits that react to the data are called **logic gates**. Putting many of these operators together in sequence produces the potential for powerful and complex computations.


## CPU, Memory, Input, & Output

-	**Input** - Converts information into binary (keyboards, mice, microphones, touch screens, sensors, etc.)
-	**CPU** - Central Processing Unit
-	**Output** - Converts binary into output information (screens, speakers, 3-D printers, mechanical devices, etc.)


## Hardware & Software

- **Hardware** - the hard components of a computer or machine (circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, etc.)
- **Software** - a series of commands composed of simple binary code; all the computer programs (or code) running on a machine (apps, games, websites, maps, creative and analytical programs, etc.)

The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of a computer. It meshes hardware and software together. CPU’s have designated parts to perform different functions for the computer. The software tells controls all the hardware within a machine and Binary code is the simplest form of software.  
The **Operating System (OS)** is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. Seemingly simultaneous programs are actually being run one at a time as the OS quickly switches between programs sharing the CPU for fractions of a second.
