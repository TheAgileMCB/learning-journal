# Code 102 Learning Journal
## Developing Feelings
### A repository of the things I've learned, the things I've failed, and the things I want to learn.

## Growth Mindset
**Growth Mindset** is the psychological principle that ones abilities and intelligence are not *fixed*, but can be *grown* and *developed*.

### Things to Keep in Mind
- It's going to be hard--that's a given. Keep going. Stay focused.
- Seek out and learn from criticism.
- Dont' let failure stop you.
      Like J.K. Rowling has said:
> Failure is so important. We Speak about success all the time. But it is the ability to resist or use failure that often leads to greater success.
