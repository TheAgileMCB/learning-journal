## Writing a Script

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break them down into smaller steps.

1.	**Define the goal** – first, define the task you want to achieve
2.	**Design the script** – split the goal out into a series of tasks. One may try representing them with a flow chart.
3.	**Code each step** – each step must be written in JavaScript

**Expressions** – an expression results in a single value. There are two types of expressions:
-	Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
o	A variable must be given a value to be useful. This is done with an assignment operator.
-	Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
o	One can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value.

**Operators** - Expressions rely on operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
-	**Assignment Operators** – assign a value to a variable
-	**Arithmetic Operators** – perform basic math
-	**String Operators** – combine two strings
-	**Comparison Operators** – compare two values and return true or false
-	**Logical Operators** – combine expressions and return true or false

## More on Arithmetic Operators

**+** - Adds one value to another
**-** - Subtracts one value from another
**/** - Divides two values
***** - Multiplies two values
**++** - Adds one to the current number
**--** Subtracts one from the current number
**%** - Divides two values and returns the remainder

**Order of Operations** – parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction

## More on String Operators

	**Concatenation** - the process of joining together two strings
**Mixing numbers and strings** - placing quotes around a number makes it a string and no longer a numeric data type. You cannot perform addition on string data types. Arithmetic operations performed on strings usually result in NaN (Not a Number).

## Functions

**Functions** let one group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Functions are *reusable*. Functions will also help one *store* the steps needed to achieve a task. In order to **call**, or ask it to operate, later a function must be given a name. Some functions must be provided with information to perform their task. This information is called **parameters**. When you write a function and expect it to produce an answer, the answer is known as a **return value**.

### function sayHello() {
### document.write(‘Hello!’);
### }

*function* is referred to as the **function keyword**. *sayHello* is the **function name** and the content with the curly braces is considered the **code block**.

### function getArea(width, height) {
### Return width * height;
### }

The content within the parentheses are **parameters**. The parameters are used like variables within the function.

When one calls a function the needs information, one must insert appropriate information within the parentheses to fulfill the parameters. This information are called **arguments**.
