## Comparison Operators

*==* - is equal to, compares two values to see if they are the same  
*!=* - is not equal to, compares two values to see if they are not the same  
*===* - strict equal to, compares two values to check that both data type and value are the same  
*!==* - strict not equal to, compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same  
*>* - greater than, checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right  
*<* - less than, checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right  
*>=* - greater than or equal to, checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right  
*<=* - less than or equal to, checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right  
*&&* - logical And, this operator tests more than one condition, if both expressions evaluate to true it will return true. If just one expression evaluates to false, the expression will return false  
*||* - Logical Or, this operator tests at least one condition, if either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true. If both return false, then the expression will return false  
*!* - Logical Not, this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it, if the statement was false it would now return true. If the statement was true it would now return false  

# ((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))

-	*(5 < 2)* is an expression
-	*&&* is a logical operator
-	*(2 >= 3)* is an expression
-	*((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))* is also considered an expression


## Loops

**For Loops**
-	runs a code a specific amount of times
-	condition is usually a counter
-	the most common type of loop

**While Loops**
-	condition can be something other than a counter
-	effective when one doesnâ€™t know how many times a code should run

**Do While Loops**
-	very similar to while loop
-	will always run the code loop *at least* once, even if the condition evaluates to false

# for (var I = 0; I < 10; i++) {
# document.write(i);
# }

*for* is the **keyword**. The content within the parentheses is the **condition** and the **counter**. The code between the curly braces is what is executed during the loop.

### Loop Counters

**Initializing**
-	create a variable and set it to a beginning value
-	this variable is commonly called *i*
-	*var i = 0;*
-	This variable is only created the first time the loop is run
-	One can use the variable *index* instead
-	The variable can also be declared before the condition

**Condition**
-	The loop will continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number
-	*i < 10;*
-	The condition may also use a variable that holds a number

**Update**
-	Every time the loop has run the statements within the curly braces it adds to the counter
-	*i++*
-	In this case, one is added each iteration
-	*++* - Increment Operator
-	*--* - Decrement Operator
