## Within the HTML Document

**Block Elements** – elements that begin on a new line
**Inline Elements** – elements that flow within the text and do not start a new line
**<link>** - can be used in a document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file associated with it
**href** – specifies the path to the CSS file
**type** – this attribute specifies the type of file being linked to. Should be “text/css”
**rel** – this specifies the relationship of the HTML document and the file it is linked to. Should be “stylesheet” when linking to a CSS file

## CSS Selectors

***{}** – universal selector
**h1, h2, h3 {}** – type selector
**.note {}** – class selector
**#introduction** – ID selector
**li>a {}** – child selector
**p a {}** – descendent selector
**h1+p {}** – adjacent sibling selector
**h1~p** – general sibling selector

## How CSS Cascades

-	Sequentially from top to bottom
-	Last rule – the latter of two identical selectors will take precedence
-	More specific selectors will override more general selectors
-	!important – after a property value will give it precedence

## Color

**RGB** – Red, Blue, and Green values from 0-255
**Hex Code** - the 6-digit hexadecimal color code
**Color Name** - CSS recognizes 147 predefined colors
**HSLA** - Hue (0-360), Saturation (0-100%), Lightness (0-100%), Alpha (0-1.0) [for opacity]

## Contrast

Text is hard to read if there is a low contrast between the background and text. It is of particular concern to those with visual impairments and color blindness or those with poor monitors. Text is easier to read when there is a higher contrast between background and foreground colors, but becomes cumbersome with large amounts of text. Medium contrast text improves readability for long spans of text.
