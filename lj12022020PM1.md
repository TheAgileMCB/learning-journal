## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Web pages are most commonly broken down into three primary languages – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is where the content of a page lives. It gives the page structure and adds semantics. CSS is the presentation layer, enhancing and styling the HTML elements. JavaScript is the behavior layer, adding interactivity and other dynamic features.

## JavaScript

# Document.write(‘Good afternoon!’);

*Document* is known as the **object**. The document object represents the entire webpage. The *write()* **method** of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the *script* element sits. The dot between *document* and *write* is known as a **member operand**. **Objects** have several **methods** which can be accessed by placing this dot between the object and the method. Each piece of information inside the parentheses of the method is called a **parameter**.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**. Statements should end with a semicolon. Statements should start on a new line. Statements can be organized into **code blocks** when they’re placed within curly braces. Code blocks help programmers organize their code and makes it more readable.

JavaScript runs where it is found. This is important because it can slow down or stop the loading of a page if the browser has to front-load a lot of JavaScript, or it can disrupt your code if scripts try to run before the page loads in elements necessary for the JavaScript functions to resolve.

It is important to make comments throughout one’s code to explain functions to oneself and others. This is particularly important when collaborating, working on large-scale projects, or inserting a lot of time between inspecting code. **//** is used to comment out information line-by-line, and is best practice to maintain the integrity of all possible inputs in JavaScript.

Variable (*var*) – a temporary container for bits of information a script needs to perform functions. Variables are composed of the **variable keyword** (var) and the **variable name** (whatever one decides to use as a memorable identifier). The variable name should describe the kind of data the variable holds. These are followed by *=* called an **assignment operator** and the **variable value** (whatever piece of data the variable name will represent). If a variable value is not assigned, the value is considered **undefined**.

6 Primitive JavaScript Data Types:
-	Number (12)
-	String (‘hello’)
-	Boolean (true/false)
-	Null 
-	Undefined
-	Symbol

**objects**, **arrays**, **null**, **undefined**, and **symbol** are data types to be described later.
