## Text Editors and IDEs

When it comes down to it, the best text editor for any person is the one that are most comfortable using. It’s a choice as personal as a sports team. So basic features, however, that will make the job of programming faster and simpler are as follows:

**Code Completion** – suggests code endings based on text a user begins to input. Will also add closing tags and brackets in some forms.  
**Emmet** – takes the input of abbreviations and easily expands them into full HTML code.  
**Syntax Highlighting** – colorizes programming language attributes for better readability and organization.  

Most every computer comes with some form of text editor preinstalled, and one can definitely write code on these editors. However, they usually lack many features and customizability. And, considering most modern code editors are free to download, this seems an ideal solution. Some third party text editors include:

**Notepad++** - only for Windows computers. Has code completion and syntax highlighting. Has its own chat room and online community.  
**TextWrangler** – only for Mac computers. Was retires in 2017.  
**BB Edit** – for-pay software. Has limited free options.  
**Visual Studio Code** – free from Microsoft. Has Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS built-in, as well as Syntax Highlighting, Code Completion, hundreds of themes and additional extensions, and a healthy developer community.  
**Atom** – a free text editor from the folks at GitHub. Has a wealth of extensions, themes, and features, much like VS Code. Integrates seamlessly with GitHub for superb project collaboration.  
**Brackets** – free software. Made by Adobe. Only supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without extensions. Good starter choice, but not necessarily good for advanced users.  
**Sublime Text** – premium software at $70. Fast and responsive. Has Syntax Highlighting, Code Completion, themes and extensions.

## Text Editors v. IDEs

IDEs are Integrated Development Environments and Text Editors edit text. IDEs ARE text editors, but also, file managers, compilers, and debuggers all together. 


## The Terminal

**Command Line** - A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

**The Shell, Bash** - This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell.

**pwd** – Print Working Directory, tells one what the current working directory is  
**ls** – List, at the most basic, it will display a plain listing of one’s current location, but it can also be run followed by [options] and [locations]  
**Absolute Paths** - specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )  
**Relative Paths** - specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.  
**cd** – Change Directory  
**Tab Completion** – hit Tab button to auto-complete the names of directories and files in the Command Prompt  
**file** – obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is  
**ls –a** – list the contents of a directory, including hidden files  

## Some things to remember about Linux:

- Everything, even directories, is a file under Linux.
- Linux is an extensionless system, so files can have any extension they like or none at all.
- Linux is case sensitive, so one must be careful and inputting each character.
